                        <h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
				<p style="padding: 20px 50px 0px 50px;text-align:justify;">We have introduced the concept of door-to-door collection of 
                    household garbage for the first time in Abbottabad.
                    Upon subscription, our smart workers would come to your house everyday collect the garbage bag 
                    filled with your daily waste. We shall provide you with 30 garbage bags each month at the minimum cost per packet.
				</p>
                <p style="padding: 20px 50px 0px 50px;text-align:justify;">We are now working towards making these bags biodegradable for a more environment friendly solution.</p>

				        <p style="padding: 20px 50px 0px 50px;text-align:justify;">Operating your business takes time and resources, which is why we offer a variety of 
                            waste removal and garbage pickup services that allow you to focus on growing your bottom line. Our commercial waste solutions and containers 
                            cater to a diverse range of residential, industrial and commercial customers.</p>
                    <p style="padding: 20px 50px 0px 50px;text-align:justify;">Compactors maximize the amount of waste by compacting the waste with a blade before it’s 
                        loaded into containers. Compactors also minimize the amount of collections that are needed over time. </p>
